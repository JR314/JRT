# JRT -- SIMPLE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

Objective
To analyze anime list data to understand user preferences and predict the anime rating a user might give based on various features like genre, release date, and other metadata. The project aims to develop a recommender system and derive insights into what factors contribute most to a user’s anime preferences.

Data Collection
Data Source: Use the MyAnimeList datasets from platforms like Kaggle that contain anime-related information (e.g., genres, studios, release year, ratings, episode counts).

Data Requirements:

Anime Data: Information about each anime (title, genre, release year, episodes, average rating, etc.)
User Ratings Data: User profiles and their anime ratings (anime watched, score given, completion status, etc.)

Project Steps:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions of anime scores, release years, genres, and episode counts.
Analyze user ratings to understand preferences in different genres, average ratings per user, and common completion rates.

Feature Engineering
User-Based Features:

Average rating given by a user, favorite genres, preferred episode length (short vs. long anime), completion rate.
Frequency of high or low ratings to assess whether a user tends to rate conservatively or generously.

Building and Training Models
Part A: Rating Prediction Model
Predict the rating a user would give to an anime they haven’t watched yet. This is essentially a regression task.

Part B: Recommender System
Develop a system that can recommend new anime for users based on their viewing and rating history.

Plot a heatmap of user-anime interactions to show rating patterns.
Display a bar chart of genre popularity by average rating or frequency.
Show the distribution of predicted vs. actual ratings for evaluation.
